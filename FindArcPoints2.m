% Function calculates the coordinate position of points that lie in the arc
% formed by the intersection of a plane and a surface mesh. The plane
% intersecting the mesh is delimited by three fiducial positions. The
% function first calculates the plane intersecting the mesh and all the
% points that delimit the boundary of the intersection. Then the total
% arc-length is calculated from those points. The points calculated are a
% percentage of the total arc-length distance apart from each other
% determined by the input Percent. The points are calculated by selecting
% all the points in the arc, computing the segment lengths between arc
% points, and then identifying the arc points that lie in the arc before
% and after the point that would make the arc-length percentage distance
% equal to the point-to-point distance. A unit vector is calculated between
% these two points and also the length remaining to make up the percentage
% length from the first point. Using the unit vector for direction and the
% remaining length for magnitude, each percentage point is found.
% Inputs: Fiducials - [x,y,z] coordinates of 3 fiducials positions that
%         describe the plane.
%         Percent - Percent subdivision desired.

%         surface mesh face.
%         MeshVertices - [x,y,z] coordinates of all the vertices in a
%         surface mesh.
% Output: ArcPts - [x,y,z] coordinates of points in the arc displaced a

% Function calculates the arc-length from a set of points along a surface.
% First, it sorts all the points so that they are ordered starting from the

% calculates the distance between all points in the arc and measures them
% to get the total arc-length. Then, it cuts the data set to only include
